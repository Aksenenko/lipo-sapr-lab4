Yet another language for academic purpose: Virtual Machine

VM main file contains sinple functions for multiplicity operations:
* Multiplicity union: {1,2,3} {4,5} -> {1,2,3,4,5}
* Multiplicity intersection: {48,62,109} {190,109,62,43} -> {62,109}
* Is number in multiplicity: {48,62,109} 48 -> 1, 68 -> 0, 105 ->0, 109 -> 1
